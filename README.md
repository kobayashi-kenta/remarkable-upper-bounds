C1_verify.m, C2_verify.m, and C3_verify.m are codes that verify Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 6.2 for C_1, C_2, C_3, and C4_verify.m is a code that verifies Theorem 6.1 for C_4.
INTALB and Symbolic Math Toolbox are required to execute these codes.

Functions of the form Lemma\*\_\* in Lemma\*\_\*.m are codes to check the correctness of the corresponding Lemma \*.\*.
Symbolic Math Toolbox is required to execute these codes.
